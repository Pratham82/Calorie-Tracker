# Calorie-Tracker




This is calorie tracker application that I have created which uses all the concepts of **Vanilla JS** and  **Module patterns** and **IFFIES**. This app is fully functional with add update delete meal item. I make use of **local storage** for making the data persistent. For styling I used **Bootstarp CSS**
